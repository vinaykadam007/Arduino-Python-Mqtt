# Arduino-Python-Mqtt

Description
<DESCRIPTION>
This repository contains the source code and resources for an Arduino IoT application that utilizes the MQTT protocol to communicate with the ThingSpeak server. The application allows you to collect data from IoT devices and send it to ThingSpeak for visualization and analysis.

Features
MQTT communication with ThingSpeak server
Data collection from IoT devices
Visualization of collected data on ThingSpeak

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/<PROJECT_NAME>.git
Open the Arduino IDE and load the project's main sketch located at <PROJECT_NAME>/src/main.ino.

Install any necessary libraries by navigating to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries in the Arduino IDE. Search for and install libraries that the project depends on.

Usage
Connect your IoT devices to the Arduino board as per the hardware setup instructions provided in the repository.

Open the main sketch in the Arduino IDE and modify the configuration settings to match your environment (such as Wi-Fi credentials, MQTT broker details, etc.).

Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

The Arduino board will now start communicating with the ThingSpeak server via MQTT and send data from your IoT devices.

Configuration
Before uploading the sketch to your Arduino board, make sure to configure the following settings in the main.ino file:

cpp
Copy code
// Wi-Fi settings
const char* ssid = "your_wifi_ssid";
const char* password = "your_wifi_password";

// MQTT settings
const char* mqttServer = "mqtt.thingspeak.com";
const int mqttPort = 1883;
const char* mqttUser = "your_mqtt_username";
const char* mqttPassword = "your_mqtt_password";
const char* mqttChannel = "your_mqtt_channel";
Replace the placeholders with your actual Wi-Fi credentials, MQTT server details, and ThingSpeak channel information.
